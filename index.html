                <p>I am Fabien. I came here 13 years ago from France after being kicked out of engineering school near
                    Paris.
                    I decided to start again with a clean slate. I decided to study in the bay area and, I wanted to do
                    it on the cheap.
                    Sadly, I did not speak english. I wrote a college application in french and used google to
                    translate it to engligh.
                    I then submitted it to a few public universities. I was rejected nearly everywhere. Luckily, I got
                    accepted at Berkeley, nearly 15 miles from my house.</p>
                <p>
                    After graduation, I decided to stay in the US.
                    Living in Berkeley was fun but I wanted more. I tried to live in San Francisco but could not afford
                    it. I found a job in tech and
                    started a real estate business in Vallejo. I also decided to live in Hayward for a year to save up.
                    It ended up being two...
                    I grew more bored and eventually managed to move downtown SF where my life took a new turn. I made
                    friends all around the city.
                    I hung out in all neighborhoods and met people from all walks of life. I also party a lot.
                    My profile pic is a selfie of myself in a hot tub :).
